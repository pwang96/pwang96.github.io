											This Christmas, my family traveled to Chappaqua, New York, to spend some time with my godmother and her family. Chappaqua is a small hamlet in the town of New Castle, New York, about 30 miles north of New York City. The people of this small community of 1,500 are so nice to each other that even the puppies have learned from them: an encounter between two dogs is nothing more than a cordial butt-sniff with no barks exchanged. Chappaqua is also the childhood home of Ben Stiller, Jeff Van Gundy, and the current home of the Clintons.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											The name Chappaqua evolved from the Algonquian word shah-pah-ka, which meant “the rustling land,” because all you could hear was the rustle of the leaves in the wind, and that is just as true today as it was in 1730 when the Quakers first settled in the area.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											My mom and I left our home in Rockville, MD at 9:30 on Saturday morning, the 23rd of December, en route to Chelsea, NYC, to pick up my brother Charles and his girlfriend Shannon. We arrived in NYC at around 3:30pm, loaded them and their presents into our already packed Acura SUV, and set off towards the rustling land. 40 minutes and 30 miles later, we drove up the long, snaking driveway to my godmother’s house and ended our voyage.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											Minutes later, we were all exchanging our holiday greetings, trying to fit two years of catching up into 15 seconds while the trunk was still open. I was most excited to see their sheepdog-corgi mix named Charlie.
